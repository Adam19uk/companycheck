Here's little research I have done about UK companies, primarly based in Warwickshire:

[Nda Recycling Limited](http://coreportsly.com/company/06818197) located at 16 Winchcombe Road, Alcester, Warwickshire B49 6QL 

[Abbreviated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2016](http://coreportsly.com/company/06818197/accounts/20160331) is available & signed by N A Harrison, Director on 2th December 2016.


Next, the [Cape Plumbing Contractors Ltd](http://coreportsly.com/company/04117700) has no accounts available yet.

There's also Alcock Watson Associates Limited http://coreportsly.com/company/01444894 based around same post code, but incorporated on 21th of August 1979 but it has no accounts as well.

An active company "St Faith'S Road Management Company Limited" very long name so here's a [link](http://coreportsly.com/company/01757496). More to come.
